<h5>New Composting Workshop!</h5>
<p>Our next workshop is entitled "Everything You Need to Know About Composting." &nbsp;This informative workshop will be great for any gardener, whether you plan to invest in a commercial compost bin or simply start a compost pile in a corner of your garden. &nbsp;You will be amazed at how quickly you can produce rich, nutrient-filled compost with only a little effort. &nbsp;Use this black gold to amend your soil naturally, yo encourage the growth of healthy plants. &nbsp;Not only willl you create rich soil and save water--you will also reduce trash at the landfill by recycling your kitchen scraps and garden materials.</p>
